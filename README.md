# PacMen-Exercise
PacMen Exercise creates a factory where one can create PacMen by clicking the ADD PACMEN botton on the screen. When the PacMen are created, the START GAME boton then begins to move the PacMen around on the screen till PacMen detect the edges of the screen and bounce off it. This animation continues till the page is refreshed.

How to Run:
Download the .js, .html and the images folder from the repository and run the index.html file in a browser. This will show the animation.

Roadmap To Future Improvemnents:
I hope to add a change color function that will make the PacMen change colors when they detect the edges of the screen. This should make the exercise more colorful.
